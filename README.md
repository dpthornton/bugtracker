Technical Test
==============

I fixed the first bug mentioned in all the SQL queries, as it was a SQL injection vulnerability and thought I may as well make the other changes. 

I chose to have a separate 'Close' issue button, even though it's effectively an issue 'edit' when closing an issue. I thought that in a system like this, the close would probably be semi-permanent to the user, so you'd want to quickly make sure the user was happy closing off the issue! 

The timezone fix I attempted to do client-side, just in case the client location is different from the server.  

The error handling I only partially completed as it wasn't clear to me what the requirements were entirely.


Goal
----

This repository contains an unfinished issue tracker web app. Your goal is to
make some of the following improvements to it:

- Fix the bug where it's not possible to add an issue titled "Can't log in"
- Fix the bug where it's not possible to close an issue
- Fix the bug where the edit screen doesn't change the description of the issue
- Make REST endpoints return a more reasonable response when requesting non-existent resources
- Add date formatting in the UI, to put timestamps in the user's local timezone
- Add a login and registration page, to enable username/password login
  - Read-only pages don't need users to be logged in, but new/edit/update pages do
  - Username must be a valid email address
  - Once this is done, add the ability to assign bugs to users, and for bugs to have creators
- Create a dashboard page with the following information:
  - How many bugs are currently open, and what percentage this is of the maximum number that were ever open at once
  - How many bugs were closed in the last week

We are more interested in looking at what you consider good practice, than in
measuring how quickly you work, so do not worry if you can't finish all the tasks.
You do not have to tackle the tasks in any particular order.

Some of the libraries and frameworks used may not be familiar to you. This is
deliberate, and you are not expected to already know them, and can refer to
online documentation.
